Shadow DOM support for the simple and complete DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing
practices you've come to know and love from Dom Testing Library.

The is an early `beta` release of the DOM Testing Library tools wrapped with some special helpers to access content in both the light and shadow DOM tree of your elements. When following the standard documentation for DOM Testing Library, it should "just work"™️! When it doesn't, it IS `beta` software after all, I hope you'll help out and ensure that the monkey patching currenly applied stays up to date and supports your follow users be productive in their testing persuits.
